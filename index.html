                <p>Hi, I’m Ryan. Here is a little bit about me.</p><br>


                <p> I started a vape juice company when I was 19, and ran it successfully for seven years. However,
                    recently I’ve decided to close the doors. I currently work for a company that produces men’s
                    rings;
                    Lashbrook Designs. I operate various CNC machines and I really enjoy it.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I was born and raised in
                    Kamas, Utah on a cattle ranch. It was a small farming-outdoorsy town when I was a child. Growing up
                    there gave me
                    a strong love for animals, being in nature, and enjoying the outdoors.</p>
                <br>
                <p> I spend a lot of my free time
                    researching
                    and learning about my passions and new things I’m interested in. Mushroom hunting,
                    gardening,
                    and beekeeping are a few of my favorite hobbies. Along with kayaking, camping, and hanging out with
                    my huskies named Akilla and June. </p>
